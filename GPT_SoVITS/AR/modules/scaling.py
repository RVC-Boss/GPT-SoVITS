    Modifies the backpropped derivatives of a function to try to encourage, for

    time.  It does this by multiplying negative derivative values by up to
    (1+max_factor), and positive derivative values by up to (1-max_factor),
    interpolated from 1 at the threshold to those extremal values when none
    of the inputs are positive.

    Args:
           num_channels: the number of channels
           channel_dim: the dimension/axis corresponding to the channel, e.g.
               -1, 0, 1, 2; will be interpreted as an offset from x.ndim if negative.
           min_positive: the minimum, per channel, of the proportion of the time
               that (x > 0), below which we start to modify the derivatives.
           max_positive: the maximum, per channel, of the proportion of the time
               that (x > 0), above which we start to modify the derivatives.
           max_factor: the maximum factor by which we modify the derivatives for
              either the sign constraint or the magnitude constraint;
              e.g. with max_factor=0.02, the the derivatives would be multiplied by
              values in the range [0.98..1.02].
           sign_gain_factor: determines the 'gain' with which we increase the
              change in gradient once the constraints on min_positive and max_positive
              are violated.
           scale_gain_factor: determines the 'gain' with which we increase the
              change in gradient once the constraints on min_abs and max_abs
              are violated.
           min_abs:  the minimum average-absolute-value difference from the mean
               value per channel, which we allow, before we start to modify
               the derivatives to prevent this.
           max_abs:  the maximum average-absolute-value difference from the mean
               value per channel, which we allow, before we start to modify
               the derivatives to prevent this.
          min_prob: determines the minimum probability with which we modify the
             gradients for the {min,max}_positive and {min,max}_abs constraints,
             on each forward().  This is done randomly to prevent all layers
             from doing it at the same time.  Early in training we may use
             higher probabilities than this; it will decay to this value.
