# Changelog

## 20240121

1. Added `is_share` to the `config`. In scenarios like Colab, this can be set to `True` to map the WebUI to the public network.
2. Added English system translation support to WebUI.
3. The `cmd-asr` automatically detects if the FunASR model is included; if not found in the default directory, it will be downloaded from ModelScope.
4. Attempted to fix the SoVITS training ZeroDivisionError reported in [Issue 79](https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS/issues/79) by filtering samples with zero length, etc.
5. Cleaned up cached audio files and other files in the `TEMP` folder.
6. Significantly reduced the issue of synthesized audio containing the end of the reference audio.

## 20240122

1. Fixed the issue where excessively short output files resulted in repeating the reference audio.
2. Tested native support for English and Japanese training (Japanese training requires the root directory to be free of non-English special characters).
3. Improved audio path checking. If an attempt is made to read from an incorrect input path, it will report that the path does not exist instead of an ffmpeg error.

## 20240123

1. Resolved the issue where Hubert extraction caused NaN errors, leading to SoVITS/GPT training ZeroDivisionError.
2. Added support for quick model switching in the inference WebUI.
3. Optimized the model file sorting logic.
4. Replaced `jieba` with `jieba_fast` for Chinese word segmentation.

## 20240126

1. Added support for Chinese-English mixed and Japanese-English mixed output texts.
2. Added an optional segmentation mode for output.
3. Fixed the issue of UVR5 reading and automatically jumping out of directories.

## 20240128

1. Fixed the issue with the pronunciation of numbers converting to Chinese characters.
2. Fixed the issue of swallowing a few characters at the beginning of sentences.
3. Excluded unreasonable reference audio lengths by setting restrictions.
4. Fixed the issue where GPT training did not save checkpoints.
5. Completed model downloading process in the Dockerfile.

## 20240129

1. Changed training configurations to single precision for GPUs like the 16 series, which have issues with half precision training.
2. Tested and updated the available Colab version.
3. Fixed the issue of git cloning the ModelScope FunASR repository with older versions of FunASR causing interface misalignment errors.

## 20240130

1. Automatically removed double quotes from all path-related entries to prevent errors from novice users copying paths with double quotes.
2. Fixed issues with splitting Chinese and English punctuation and added punctuation at the beginning and end of sentences.
3. Added splitting by punctuation.

4. Optimized English text frontend.
5. Fixed Gradio dependencies.
6. Supported automatic reading of `.list` full paths if the root directory is left blank during dataset preparation.
7. Integrated Faster Whisper ASR for Japanese and English.
