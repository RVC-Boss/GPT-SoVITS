### Best Practices for Users

To maintain security while using GPT-SoVITS-WebUI:

- **Update Regularly**: Always use the latest version to ensure you're benefiting from security updates.
- **Environment Isolation**: Run the application in isolated environments (e.g., Docker, Conda environments) to reduce potential risks.
- **Data Privacy**: Avoid using sensitive or private data unless necessary, as models are not encrypted by default.

### Security Practices

To ensure a secure codebase, we follow these practices:

- **Dependency Monitoring**: Regular updates and audits of third-party dependencies.
- **Code Reviews**: All new contributions undergo thorough reviews to ensure they meet our security standards.
- **Static Analysis**: Automated tools are used to identify common vulnerabilities in the code.
